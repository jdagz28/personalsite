👋 Hi there! I am Joshua Dagoy, a passionate self-taught programmer driven by continuous learning and creative problem-solving.

🔬🌊  Formerly a marine biologist, I am currently immersing myself in the world of computer science as a student at Campus19💻, a unique coding school that emphasizes peer-to-peer and project-based learning. This journey has cultivated a mindset centered around self-directed learning.

</> Alongside my studies, I am enrolled in online courses, with Harvard's CS50x holding the top spot as my favorite. Currently, I am working to finish my final project 🚀.

I launched this website with 🇷, as R sparked my coding passion during graduate studies. Excitingly, I've committed to being a consistent contributor to the 🇷 weekly #TidyTuesday DataViz challenge throughout 2024, after a hiatus last year.

Join me on this coding adventure and witness my transition to tech! 🌐💡 #PassionateProgrammer #MarineBiologistInTech
