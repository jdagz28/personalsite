abstract: "Vegetation is an important ecological component of offshore islands
  in the Arabian Gulf (AG), which maintains long-term resilience of these
  islands. This is achieved by influencing sediment retention and moisture
  acquisition via condensation during periods of high humidity and by providing
  a variety of microhabitats for island fauna. The resilience of offshore
  islands’ ecosystems in the Saudi waters is important because they host the
  largest number of nesting hawksbill and green turtles in the AG. This study
  defines the characteristics and the long-term trends in vegetation cover of
  the offshore islands used by sea turtles as nesting grounds in the northern
  AG. To establish a ground-validated baseline for vegetation profiles, a 50 m ×
  50 m grid system is developed on Karan and Jana islands (Is.) with
  photo-quadrats taken at each grid intersection. The 1,317 and 444
  photo-quadrats, for Karan and Jana Is., respectively, were analyzed for
  maximum plant height and percent cover of living (green) plants, dead plants,
  and bare sand. Landsat 7 and 8 satellite top-of-atmosphere reflectance images
  were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from
  1999 through 2018 to analyze the long-term vegetation profiles of the islands.
  Monthly rainfall data from five meteorological stations along the Eastern
  Province of Saudi Arabia and Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) are presented to provide
  a context of the long-term NDVI time series variability. The ground-validated
  vegetation profiles provided baseline data during the onset of summer in 2017
  and revealed differences in maximum plant height and the extent of living,
  dead vegetation and sand cover on Jana Is. (28.3 cm, 19.9%, 63.3%, and 16.8%)
  and Karan Is. (21.7 cm, 20.6%, 48.7%, and 30.7%), respectively. The NDVI data
  for both islands are grouped into three periods, namely: 2001–2007 - high
  winter, low summer; 2008–2013 – low winter, low summer; 2014–2018 – irregular
  high/low winter, low summer. The long-term trend showed a slightly decreasing
  NDVI when compared in the context of the high NDVI measured for the two
  islands during the early 2000 s, particularly during the winter time. An
  extended reduction in winter NDVI was recorded for six years from 2008 to
  2013, which coincided with reduced rainfall in the region and prolonged La
  Niña. Five extreme dips in winter NDVI values coincided with strong (2000,
  2008, and 2011) and moderate (2012 and 2018) La Niña events. Long-term
  vegetation profiles of the offshore islands seemed to be tightly coupled with
  long-term rainfall patterns."
