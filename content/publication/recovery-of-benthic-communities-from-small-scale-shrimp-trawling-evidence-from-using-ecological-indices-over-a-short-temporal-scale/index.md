abstract: Mobile fishing gears are responsible of various direct effects on
  benthic communities. The most important (in volume and value) fishery in Saudi
  waters of the Arabian Gulf is the 6-month trawl season for the green tiger
  shrimp. The fleet is composed of hundreds of artisanal boats carrying out
  short-duration tows of small trawls. To study the impact of this trawl season
  on local benthic communities, two different methodologies were adopted in
  three areas of different trawling intensities. The first study design was
  aimed at the seasonal effect and the second design examined the immediate
  impact after the pass of a trawl. Both studies were evaluated using univariate
  ecological indicators (richness, diversity, AMBI, M-AMBI) and the multivariate
  species composition. The seasonal study revealed a cyclic dynamics of the
  benthic assemblages. Most of the univariate ecological descriptors decreased
  during the trawling season and increased during the off-season while species
  composition undertook a round trip in multivariate space, thus supporting the
  conclusion that the impact of trawling on the benthic ecosystem during the
  shrimp season is reverted during the trawl ban. Although our results confirm
  predictions of synthetic statistical models, they also show that the impact of
  trawling on benthic communities strongly depend on the existence of a trawl
  ban period.
