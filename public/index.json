I am Joshua Dagoy, a passionate self-taught programmer driven by continuous learning and creative problem-solving.\n🔬🌊 Formerly a marine biologist, I am currently immersing myself in the world of computer science as a student at Campus19💻, a unique coding school that emphasizes peer-to-peer and project-based learning. This journey has cultivated a mindset centered around self-directed learning.\n\u0026lt;/\u0026gt; Alongside my studies, I am enrolled in online courses, with Harvard\u0026rsquo;s CS50x holding the top spot as my favorite. Currently, I am working to finish my final project 🚀.\nI launched this website with 🇷, as R sparked my coding passion during graduate studies. Excitingly, I\u0026rsquo;ve committed to being a consistent contributor to the 🇷 weekly #TidyTuesday DataViz challenge throughout 2024, after a hiatus last year.\nJoin me on this coding adventure and witness my transition to tech! 🌐💡 #PassionateProgrammer #MarineBiologistInTech\n","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to the Personal Website of Joshua Dagoy","summary":"👋 Hi there!","title":"Welcome to the Personal Website of Joshua Dagoy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
